This movie app allows the user to view the most popular movies by using an API to fetch data into my application.

It will display the image of the movie with the title and rating below. The colour of the rating will depend on the final score. If it is rated above 8 it will be green, above 5 it will be orange and anything else will be red.

When the user hovers over the movie it will have a nice little transition affect to showcase a description of each movie, I have also added a search bar if the user decides to look up a specific movie of their choice.
